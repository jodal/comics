This change log is used to track all major changes to *comics* after the first
versioned release.


Unreleased
==========

Features:

* Update ``uvod`` crawler to use new feed.


1.0.0.rc2 (2010-01-19)
======================

Second release candidate for 1.0.0. Again, I will bump to 1.0.0 in a week if no
new issues arises.

Bugfixes:

* Make core/0006 migration work on the sqlite3 backend.


1.0.0.rc1 (2010-01-17)
======================

First release, so no list of changes. Will bump to 1.0.0 in a week if no issues
arise. Please report any problems at http://github.com/jodal/comics/issues.

Development on *comics* as a Python/Django project started in February 2007, so
this release has been almost three years in the making. Far too long, and I
promise it won't be three years until the next release.
