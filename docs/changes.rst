v2.3.0 (2014-04-07)
===================

- Dependencies with new minimum versions:

  - Django >= 1.6, < 1.7
  - django-boostrap-form >= 3.1, < 3.2

- Dependencies with new maximum versions:

  - cssmin >= 0.1, < 0.3

- Upgraded to JQuery 2. IE6/7/8 are no longer supported. IE9 is the oldest IE
  version you can expect to work with *comics*.

- Moved comics list from bottom of each page to its own page in the top menu.
  This makes it more available on mobile clients, as well as to new users that
  don't know where to find the list after they've subscribed to their first
  comic.

- Use Moment.js to show time since fetched timestamp in release meta data.
  This can't be done on the server side due to heavy caching.


v2.2.3 (2014-03-31)
===================

- Update: ``scenesfromamultiverse`` after feed change.
- Update: ``toothpastefordinner`` after feed change.


v2.2.1 (2013-11-08)
===================

- **Security:** Disabled the GZip middleware to help prevent the BREACH attack.
  See https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/aug/06/breach-and-django/ for
  details.

- The feedback form no longer uses the logged in user's email address as the
  sender address as this can cause the mail to be rejected due to sender
  validation and similar anti spam measures. The user's email is still in the
  email signature and is now also in the mail's ``Reply-To`` header.

- The status page now sorts comics by the number of days since the last
  release, moving the comics most in need of maintenance to the top of the
  page.

v2.1.1 (2013-02-26)
===================

**Crawlers**

- New: ``lunchtu``
- New: ``mutts``. Contributed by Anders Birkenes.
- New: ``pelsogpoter``. Contributed by Anders Birkenes.
- New: ``stickygillybuns``
- New: ``undeclaredmajor``

- Update: ``bizarro`` after feed change.
- Update: ``joyoftech`` after site change.
- Update: ``lookingforgroup`` after feed change.
- Update: ``thegamercat`` to be more robust.


v2.1.0 (2012-10-15)
===================

- Added a :doc:`webservice` interface to the *comics* instance's data to
  enable the development of custom frontends to *comics* and apps for Android
  and iOS.

- Improved admin interface. A lot of fields on the comic, release, and image
  models are now read-only, as they are only intended to be changed by the
  ``comics_addcomics`` and ``comics_getreleases`` commands. The comics admin
  interface is mainly intended for browsing and deleting
  comics/releases/images, not changing.

- Proper time zone support for comics crawling. We now calculate the current
  date at the location a comic is published using time zone aware datetime
  objects for the current time, which are converted to the comic's local time
  zone using ``pytz``.

- Removed the setting ``COMICS_DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE``.

- Updated time zone data for all crawlers. A lot of releases will now be
  fetched an hour earlier during daylight savings time, which is now taken into
  consideration when crawling.


v2.0.1 (2012-10-06)
===================

- Add dependency on ``pytz``.
- Make conversion from publication date to epoch used by 11 crawlers aware of
  the time zone.
- Set sender of feedback emails to the email address of the logged in user.

**Crawlers**

- New: ``antics``
- New: ``beetlebailey``
- New: ``choppingblock``
- New: ``dungeond``
- New: ``dustin``
- New: ``exiern``
- New: ``pickles``

- Update: ``wulffmorgenthaler`` to fetch the previous day due to releases being
  delayed.
- Update: ``yehudamoon`` after site change.
- Update: ``zelda`` schedule.
- Update: ``zits`` after site change.


v2.0.0 (2012-06-11)
===================

Version 2 refreshes the entire *comics* web interface. The aggregation part
of *comics* is mostly unchanged since v1.1.

- Design: New design based on Twitter Bootstrap.

- User accounts:

  - Add user account registration flow, which includes email address
    verification, login, logout, password change, and password reset.

  - Add account management interface.

  - Add user information to footer of emails sent from the feedback page.

  - Require a user specific secret key to allow access to feeds. (Fixes:
    :issue:`25`)

  - Add support for requiring an invitation to register as a new user. Set the
    setting ``INVITE_MODE`` to ``True`` to require invitation before
    registration. (Fixes: :issue:`29`)

- "My comics":

  - Replace named comic sets with comic subscriptions associated with users,
    called "my comics". An importer for converting old comics sets to "my
    comics" is included. (Fixes: :issue:`26`, :issue:`27`)

  - Add buttons to all comic views for adding the comic to "my comics".

  - Extend comics list in the footer to include subscription management.
    (Fixes: :issue:`28`, :issue:`49`)

- Comics browsing:

  - Orders the "latest" view by fetched time instead of comic name. New content
    is always at the top. (Fixes: :issue:`13`)

  - Removes browsing of weeks or N days, with the exception of +1 days, which
    is kept as a "today" view.

  - Reimplemented lots of crusty old code using Django's class-based generic
    views.

  - Reimplement feeds using regular views instead of Django's feed abstraction
    to reduce the feed response time enough to not cause timeouts when using
    e.g. Netvibes to subscribe to feeds. (Fixes: :issue:`5`)

- Comics crawling:

  - Try to verify that image files are valid by loading them with PIL before
    saving them. (Fixes: :issue:`17`)

  - Use PIL instead of server provided MIME types to identify the image type.

  - Removed unused ``check_image_mime_type`` crawler setting.

  - Whitelist GIF, JPEG, and PNG files. All other file types are rejected.
    (Fixes: :issue:`16`)

  - Blacklisted the GoComics placeholder image.

- Development:

  - The WSGI file is now also used when using Django's ``runserver`` command
    while developing, making the development and deployment environments more
    alike.


v1.1 to v2.0 migration guide
----------------------------

- New dependencies:

  - django-registration >= 0.8, < 0.9

  - django-bootstrap-form >= 2.0, < 2.1

- Updated dependencies:

  - Django >= 1.4, < 1.5

  - django_compressor >= 1.1, < 1.2

- Settings:

  - Removed setting ``COMICS_SITE_TAGLINE``.

  - Replaced setting ``COMICS_MAX_DAYS_IN_PAGE`` with
    ``COMICS_MAX_RELEASES_PER_PAGE``.

  - Removed ``COMICS_MEDIA_ROOT`` and ``COMICS_MEDIA_URL``. As static files
    now are located under ``STATIC_ROOT`` and ``STATIC_URL``, the entire
    namespace under ``MEDIA_ROOT`` and ``MEDIA_URL`` are now available for
    downloaded media, e.g. crawled comics.

- Commands:

  - ``loadmeta`` is now called ``comics_addcomics``. It no longer defaults to
    adding all comics to your installation, but you must now specify ``-c all``
    to do so.

  - ``getcomics`` is now called ``comics_getreleases``

  Remember to update your cronjobs.

- Project layout:

  - Moved ``manage.py`` one level higher in the directory structure, to follow
    the new defaults in Django 1.4. Again, remember to update your cronjobs.

  - Moved file with WSGI application from ``wsgi/deploy.wsgi`` to
    ``comics/wsgi/__init__.py`` to follow the new default structure in Django
    1.4. Remember to update your web server configuration.

- As the comic sets functionality have been replaced, the app ``comics.sets``
  is no longer activated by default. If you're upgrading from comics v1.x and
  have existing sets in your database, you *should* activate the
  ``comics.sets`` app so that your users may import their old comic sets into
  their new user accounts. Add the following to your local settings file,
  ``comics/settings/local.py``::

      from comics.settings.base import INSTALLED_APPS
      INSTALLED_APPS += ('comics.sets',)

- Renamed :class:`MetaBase` to :class:`ComicDataBase`, and moved it to
  :mod:`comics.core.comic_data`. Remember to update any custom crawlers.

- Database changes:

  - The field :attr:`Comic.number_of_sets` have been removed as it is no longer
    used.  If you would want to rollback from 2.x to 1.x the data in this field
    can be regenerated, as it's only a denormalization of data available
    elsewhere.

  - The datetime field :attr:`Comic.added` has been added. It is automatically
    populated with a date in the far past upon database migration.

  - Added two new database indexes to the :class:`Release` model, which both
    help a lot towards making comics browsing faster. They will be
    automatically created on database migration.

  All of these changes can be automatically applied to your database. To do so,
  run::

      python manage.py syncdb --migrate


v1.1.6 (2012-06-10)
===================

**Bugfixes**

- :meth:`LxmlParser.text()` now returns an empty list if :attr:`allow_multiple`
  is :class:`True` and :attr:`default` is not specified. This is identical to
  how all other :class:`LxmlParser` selector methods already work.

v1.1.4 (2012-04-07)
===================

**Bugfixes**

- Store only the name of recently used sets in the session, instead of full
  set objects. After applying this fix, you should either delete all existing
  sessions::

      $ python manage.py shell
      >>> from django.contrib.sessions.models import Session
      >>> Session.objects.all().delete()

  Or migrate the content of your existing sessions::

      $ python manage.py cleanup
      $ python manage.py shell

      # Then run the following Python script in the Python shell:

      from django.contrib.sessions.backends.db import SessionStore
      from django.contrib.sessions.models import Session
      store = SessionStore()

v1.1.2 (2011-09-18)
===================

A couple of bugfixes easing the transition from 1.0.x to 1.1.x by jwyllie83,
and some new crawlers.

**Bugfixes**

- Updated South requirement to v0.7, which is needed to support the last
  migration introduced by comics v1.1.0.

- If you use WSGI, you can now add a file ``wsgi/local.py`` based off of
  ``wsgi/local.py.template`` to set local settings for WSGI, like the use of
  ``virtualenv`` and debugging settings. This removes the need for changing Git
  tracked files, like ``deploy.wsgi`` for adding e.g. ``virtualenv`` support.

**Crawlers**

- New: ``buttersafe``
- New: ``doghouse``
- New: ``eatthattoast``
- New: ``hejibits``
- New: ``optipess``
- New: ``savagechickens``
- New: ``threewordphrase``
- New: ``timetrabble``
- Update ``pennyarcade`` after site change.


v1.1.1 (2011-08-22)
===================

Some fixes a week after the v1.1 feature release.

**Bugfixes**

- Fix missing whitespaces on about page after HTML minification.
- Add missing CSRF token to feedback form.

**Crawlers**

- Update ``asofterworld`` to work after feed change.


v1.1.0 (2011-08-15)
===================

- New/upgraded requirements:

  - Django 1.3
  - django_compressor
  - cssmin
  - jsmin

- Page speed improvements:

  - CSS and JavaScript is now merged and minified.
  - HTML is minified.
  - Optional Google Analytics code is upgraded to the asynchronous version.
  - All icons have been replaced with sprites to reduce number of elements that
    must be downloaded.

- Slightly refreshed graphical design.

- The "all comics" list at the bottom of the page have been changed from a
  cloud to lists in four columns.

- The optional comic meta data search functionality have been removed.

- Better handling of inactive comics:

  - Add ``active`` flag to comics.
  - Marked no longer published comics as inactive.
  - Inactive comics are no longer loaded by the ``loadmeta``  command unless
    explicitly specified by name or they have been previously loaded. In other
    words, inactive comics will not automatically be included in new
    installations.
  - Inactive comics are no longer included in the top 10 on the front page.
  - Inactive comics are now marked in the comics list on the bottom of all
    pages.
  - Inactive comics are now marked in the comics list page.
  - Inactive comics are now excluded from the set edit form, effectively
    removing them from the set on save.


v1.0.x to v1.1.x migration guide
--------------------------------

Ordered steps for syncronizing your v1.0.x installation with v1.1.0. You
should perform them in order.

**Using virtualenv**

If you choose to use ``virtualenv`` keeping all of comics' dependencies
sandboxed, be sure to activate the environment both in your cronjob and when
manually executing ``manage.py``::

    source <path_to_virtualenv>/bin/activate
    python manage.py getcomics

If you use WSGI, the WSGI file must be modified to support ``virtualenv``. See
the source code for how the bundled WSGI file solves this.

**New dependencies**

There are several new dependencies. All of them are listed in the file
``requirements.txt`` and may be installed using ``pip``, optionally inside a
``virtualenv``::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

To avoid compiling dependencies which are not pure Python and thus requires the
installation of various C libraries and Python's development packages, it may
be wise to use your distribution's package manger for some packages, like
``lxml`` and ``PIL``. E.g. on Ubuntu I would install the dependencies like
this::

    sudo apt-get install python-lxml python-imaging
    pip install -r requirements.txt

This way, ``lxml`` and ``PIL`` are installed from APT, and ``pip`` installs the
remaining pure Python dependencies.

**Settings changes**

Database settings now use the new `Django 1.2 format
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.2/#specifying-databases>`_.
See ``comics/settings/base.py`` for the new default setting and use it as an
example for porting your ``comics/settings/local.py`` settings file.

**Database migration**

A new database field has been added. To migrate your database to work with
v1.1.0, run::

    python manage.py migrate

.. warning ::

    You need South v0.7 or later to perform the database migration.

    comics v1.1.0's ``requirements.txt`` file only require South v0.6 or later.
    This is a bug, and the migration will not work if you're using South
    v0.6.x.

**Static files  collection**

We now use Django's new static files system. After installing you need to
"collect" your static files. See :ref:`collecting-static-files` for how to do
this.


v1.0.8 (2011-08-10)

v1.0.6 (2011-02-19)
===================

The 1.0.6 release includes two bugfixes, five new crawlers, and many updated
crawlers. Also, most crawler schedules have been updated to make the status
page more useful.

**Bugfixes**

- :class:`comics.aggregator.lxmlparser.LxmlParser` methods now returns an empty
  list if ``allow_multiple`` is :class:`True` and no value is given for
  ``default``. This ensures that using the return value in for loops will not
  fail if no matches are found.

- :meth:`comics.aggregator.crawler.CrawlerBase.get_crawler_release` does no
  longer create empty releases if the ``do_crawl`` method returns false values,
  like empty lists. It previously only stopped processing if ``do_crawl``
  returned :class:`None`.

- Remove ``safe`` filter from title text, and explicitly use ``escape``, even
  though they should be implicitly escaped. Thanks to XKCD #859.

**Crawlers**

- A lot of comic release schedule updates.
- New: ``nerfnow``
- New: ``romanticallyapocalyptic``
- New: ``schlockmercenary``
- New: ``spaceavalanche``
- New: ``treadingground``

- Update ``threepanelsoul`` to work after feed change.

A week has gone, and here is the 1.0.0 final release. Enjoy :-)

**Crawlers**

- Update ``uvod`` crawler to use new feed.


v1.0.0.rc2 (2010-01-19)
=======================

Second release candidate for 1.0.0. Again, I will bump to 1.0.0 in a week if no
new issues arises.

**Bugfixes**

- Make ``core/0006`` migration work on the sqlite3 backend.


v1.0.0.rc1 (2010-01-17)
=======================

First release, so no list of changes. Will bump to 1.0.0 in a week if no issues
arise. Please report any problems at http://github.com/jodal/comics/issues.

Development on *comics* as a Python/Django project started in February 2007, so
this release has been almost three years in the making. Far too long, and I
promise it won't be three years until the next release.
